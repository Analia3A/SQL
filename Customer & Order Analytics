-- Customer & Order Analytics Project

# In this porject I'm executing a SQL query to gather statistics on customer and order data from a database that contains multiple tables.


-- 1.How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6  
AND orderID <>'Order ID';


-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

#Inspecting the tables first
SELECT *
FROM customers;

SELECT *
FROM FebSales;


SELECT DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN FebSales f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(order_id)=6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';


-- 4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

# OR

SELECT DISTINCT Product, price 
FROM JanSales
WHERE price IN(SELECT MIN(price)
FROM JanSales);

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT * FROM JanSales;


SELECT Product, 
       SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price ASC;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT * FROM FebSales;


SELECT Product,
       SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold,
       SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?



SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum), 
       AVG(f.quantity*price)
FROM FebSales f
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id 
WHERE f.Quantity > 2
AND length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT DISTINCT Product,
       SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
